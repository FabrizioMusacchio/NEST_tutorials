# Neural Dynamics: A collection of educational Python scripts

![img](images/single_neuron_iaf_psc_alpha_Ie_376.0.png)

## What is neural dynamics?
Neural dynamics studies how the activity of neurons and neural networks evolves over time. It focuses on the mathematical and computational description of spiking behavior, membrane potentials, oscillations, synchronization, attractor states, and learning through synaptic plasticity. Typical approaches include differential-equation-based neuron models, spiking neural networks, and dynamical-systems analysis. Neural dynamics forms a central part of computational neuroscience, providing theoretical tools to understand how neural circuits generate computation, memory, and behavior.

## Purpose of this collection
This repository provides a collection of educational Python scripts that explore core concepts in neural dynamics. The focus is on interpretable models and simulations such as integrate-and-fire neurons, spiking neural networks, and plasticity rules. The goal is to offer concise, well-documented examples that support learning, experimentation, and theoretical exploration, rather than large-scale machine-learning frameworks. The scripts are intended for everyone who want to build intuition for dynamical processes in neural systems and reproduce classic results from theoretical neuroscience.

Each script in this repository is accompanied by a detailed blog post that explains the underlying concepts, mathematical formulations, and implementation details. The blog posts provide context and guidance to help you to understand the significance of each simulation and how it relates to broader topics in computational neuroscience.
